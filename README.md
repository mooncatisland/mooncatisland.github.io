# Mooncat Island
 


## DEV TODO 
1. use caching to find mooncats and wrapped mooncats, stick them in the database   - try the graph 
2. Make the bank work nicely so we can print MoonMoney 
3. Create the launchpad very similarly to mooncatrescue website - integrate CPU mining in browser w JS 
4. Toys tab will show you all of your toys (how to get this data..? mine for it)


-Generate cat stats based on ID  (Strength, Charisma, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Initiative)
-Use mongo to serve a text-based RPG
